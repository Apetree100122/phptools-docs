Welcome to PHP Tools for Visual Studio Code. The following guide will help you with the basics, so you can quickly start working with PHP in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

> **Note:** PHP Tools for Visual Studio Code is a Visual Studio Code extension.

## Getting to know the IDE

The Visual Studio main window is divided into several areas - menu bar, status bar, editor area, side panel containing the Solution Explorer, and various toolbars. All the positions can be changed. The following image describes the default layout.

When you launch Visual Studio, you are welcomed with the Start Page. This allows you to open recent projects or create new ones quickly.

When a project is opened, you can see the files that are a part of the project in the Solution Explorer. The Solution Explorer allows you to manage, search and open files, their properties and the project properties.

The editor area contains opened files. It allows you to see and modify the content, and take advantage of advanced IntelliSense features, navigation features, syntax highlighting, live error detection and more.
