# Getting started

## Product activation

The product is licensed to our active subscribers. See [the purchase page](https://www.devsense.com/purchase) for more information. After the successful installation, you'll be prompted for the license key, or an option to obtain a trial key upon entering your e-mail.

## Configuring PHP

Vast majority of the extension's features work out of the box. The debugger and test explorer functionalities require, however, a working installation of [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) together with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) extension.

See [configuration](/vscode/configuration) for more information.
