## Configuring PHP

The vast majority of the extension's features work out of the box. The debugger and test explorer functionalities require, however, a working installation of [PHP](https://secure.php.net/) together with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) extension.

See [configuration](/vscode/configuration) for more information.
