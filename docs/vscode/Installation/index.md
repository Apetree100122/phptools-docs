After the successful installation, please [activate](#license-activation) your copy of PHP Tools.

## Offline installation

Download the `.vsix` installation file from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode). The installation file has to be installed using the Visual Studio Code' `Command palette`, using the command `Extensions: Install from VSIX`.

## Pre-Release Installation

PHP Tools are released in a Stable and Pre-Release version. By default, the stable version is installed. The Pre-Release versions are updated more frequently, containing the most recent fixes and new features.
