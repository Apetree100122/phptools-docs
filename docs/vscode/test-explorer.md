## Configuration

It is necessary to configure the system, before the tests can be executed. The process requires the PHPUnit phar file and a configuration file. 

The test results are generated by running the **php -d display_errors=on PHPUnit.phar --teamcity** in the workspace root directory. This command relies on the *phpunit.xml* to be present in the root and point to all the required tests.

### PHP

Tests require working PHP. The tests use either the executable defined in the user settings by *php.executablePath* or just by running *php* on the command line if the value is not set.

### PHPUnit

The PHPUnit phar file is necessary to execute the tests. PHP Tools try to locate PHPUnit phar in the vendor directory created by composer. If PHP Tools are unable to locate the phar in the vendor directory then they use a built-in PHPUnit phar version 6.5.12.
