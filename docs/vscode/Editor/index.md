The editor has the following features:

- [code completion](editor/completion)
- code folding
- code validation
- [signature help](editor/signature)
- [tooltip help](editor/tooltips)
- [symbol renaming](editor/refactoring)
- [symbol navigation](editor/navigation)
- breadcrumbs
- code outline
- [code formatting](editor/formatting)
- [mixed html/js/css/php syntax](editor/html-js-css)
- dimming unused and unreachable code
- light bulbs with code actions

Note: some editor features may work properly only after the project has been fully loaded.
