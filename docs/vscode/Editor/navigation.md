# Navigation Overview

PHP Tools provide three ways to efficiently navigate the PHP source code. All the approaches integrate with the existing Visual Studio Code user interface. The navigation may not be able to locate symbols in invalid PHP files, because syntax errors may change meaning of code.

## Go To Definition

PHP Tools support the [Go To Definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition) feature invoked by the `F12` key.

## Go to Symbol

PHP Tools support the [Go to Symbol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-symbol) feature invoked by the `Ctrl+Shift+O` key.

## Open Symbol by Name

PHP Tools support the [Open Symbol by Name](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_open-symbol-by-name) feature invoked by the `Ctrl+T` key.
