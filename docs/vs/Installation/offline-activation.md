## Offline Activation

In case there is no Internet connection available or the Internet is blocked by company policies, the activation can be processed in a web browser on another machine with working Internet connection.

![Get alternate URL](imgs/offline-activate1.png)

Proceed to the normal product activation by entering your license key, as described above. The activation dialog will popup a message saying it cannot reach the server and **provides an alternate URL** that can be copied and opened in a web browser with working connection.

After opening the URL in the web browser, the page generates an offline key (*a long base64-encoded text*) which can be copied and pasted back to the activation dialog, instead of the regular license key.
