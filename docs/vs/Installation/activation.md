# Product Activation

Once you have [downloaded PHP Tools](https://www.devsense.com/en/download), [installed it](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vs/installation) and [installed PHP](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vs/installation/install-php), it's time to activate the product.

PHP Tools for Visual Studio comes with a free trial to evaluate the software. You can enable the trial first to see whether PHP Tools suits you. The trial allows free access to all developing features for 30 days. When the trial ends, you can activate the software using a purchased license key.

## Activate Trial

As explained before, PHP Tools for Visual Studio comes with a free, 30-day trial. This trial can be started anytime, but until then, only a set of basic features will work. PHP Tools will ask to start the trial every time Visual Studio starts (see picture below).
