# Product Activation

PHP Tools add-in comes with a trial software. You can enable the trial first to see whether PHP Tools suits you. Enabling the trial or activating the software using a purchased license key gives you the full developers features.

## Activate trial

You can start with the free 30-day trial and evaluate the software. The trial can be started whenever you want, until then only the set of basic features will work. PHP Tools add-in asks to start the trial when Visual Studio starts (see below).
