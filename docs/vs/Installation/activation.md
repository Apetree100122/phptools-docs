# Product Activation

Once you have [downloaded PHP Tools](https://www.devsense.com/en/download), [installed it](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vs/installation) and [installed PHP](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vs/installation/install-php), it's time to activate the product.

PHP Tools for Visual Studio comes with a free trial to evaluate the software. You can enable the trial first to see whether PHP Tools suits you. The trial allows free access to all developing features for 30 days. When the trial ends, you can activate the software using a purchased license key.

## Activate Trial

As explained before, PHP Tools for Visual Studio comes with a free, 30-day trial. This trial can be started anytime, but until then, only a set of basic features will work. PHP Tools will ask to start the trial every time Visual Studio starts (see picture below).

## User Seats

Licenses are assigned to individual users and computers upon first activation. In the case a computer is no longer in use, or a user is no longer actively using the license, you can unregister them to free up their seat for another user. Visit the [**Dashboard**](https://www.devsense.com/account/dashboard) in the upper right corner of this web site to do so.

1. **Create a new user account** in the dashboard, or login using available social login.
2. In case there is no *License Key* listed in your Dashnoard, **Associate License Key** first.
3. Navigate to **Subscriptions** and adjust number of seats, or disable associated seats to free them for new users.
