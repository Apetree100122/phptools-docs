Visual Studio offers incredibly rich debugging environment and knowing these features can save lot of time. We are happy to announce that this release includes debug features which are hard to find in any other PHP IDE, some of them are:

- Tracepoints ("When Hit" breakpoints)
- Conditional breakpoints which can break when value of the expression has changed (not just when it is TRUE)
- HitCount Breakpoints
- Run To Cursor (Ctrl+F10)
- and more
