Welcome to the March 2023 release of PHP Tools for Visual Studio!

## Inlay Hints

Sometimes it is not clear what function arguments are used for. We are adding so-called inlay hints that annotate function parameters, inferred function return type, by-ref semantics to arguments, and expressions type.

Enable or disable Inlay Hints in `Tools`/`Options`, under `Text Editor`/`PHP`/`Inlay Hints`,

## Short Open Tags Option

Now you can force the PHP Editor to treat short open tags `<?` differently. Go to `Tools`/`Options`, into `Text Editor`/`PHP`/`Advanced`. You'll find an option called **Short Open Tags**. You can enable or disable treating short open tags, or leave it to "Auto" which is the legacy behavior.

Previously the editor was parsing code next to `<?` according to various settings and the current PHP version.
