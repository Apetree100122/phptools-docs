As always, the selection configures the code IntelliSense and code diagnostics accordingly to the selected version for PHP. Also, it automatically installs the PHP itself, including the debugging extension. Additionally, it keeps it updated.

## Improvements

- IntelliSense recognizes class names within parameters of PHP 8 attributes.
- Displaying x86/x64 flag in IIS server in Project Properties.
- Improves performance of outputting text to Visual Studio output panes.
- Improves code analysis when passing non-variables by reference.
- When installing IISExpress automatically, IISExpress 10 is installed now instead of IISExpress 8.

## Debug

- Immediate and Watch windows show the reason why expression couldn't be evaluated.
- Track objects (*Make Object ID*) improved.
- Eval' result expansion doesn't cause side-effects.
- Edit value correctly escapes string values.
- Xdebug extension automatically updated.
- Improves debugger stability.

## Fixes

- Fixes occasional freezes when switching project to use IIS web server.
- Hides PHP property page in non-PHP projects.
- Fixes `F12` when navigating to `include` file path.
- Fixes IntelliSense not showing/recognizing STD global constants.
