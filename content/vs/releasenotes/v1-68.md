Welcome to the September 2022 release of PHP Tools for Visual Studio!

## PHP 8.2

The new version of PHP, the version **8.2**, will be released soon (expecting November 2022). Our PHP editor is getting ready, and it already supports most of the new language syntax. You can try the new `readonly` classes, and even use the the latest development build of PHP 8.2 right in Visual Studio.

Just go to your PHP project properties, and choose `PHP 8.2 (x64) DEV`. It will get installed and configured for debugging automatically.
