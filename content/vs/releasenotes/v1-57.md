Welcome to the PHP Tools for Visual Studio update. Check out what's new and what has been updated.

## Debugger

This update improves existing debugger functionaity, and adds new features.

### Make Object ID

The new debugger feature alows to **pin** an object from Watch Window or Quick Watch using `Make Object ID` context menu command. The pinned object can be tracked during the whole request execution.

Pinning an object creates a weak reference which can be always revealed in **Locals** window or in **Watch** window using **`$1`** alias (or `$2`, `$3`, ... correspondingly). Pinned objects are also marked in quick watches by its {$-index} alias. This works even within arrays and inside other objects.

## Editor

IntelliSense tool-tips and error tool-tips are now shown even during debugging. Previously, tool-tips were only displayed when Visual Studio was in design mode (not debug mode).

## Fixes

- Rename refactoring correctly replaces class names within `extends` and `implements`.
- Fixes some errors locations, e.g. the warning about overflowing an integer number into floating-point number.
