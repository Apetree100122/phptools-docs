## Debugger

### Object ID

The new feature alows to **pin** object from Watch or Quick Watch using `Make Object ID` context menu command. The pinned object can be watched during the whole request execution, on any stack frame.

Pinning an object creates a weak reference which can be always revealed in **Locals** window or in **Watch** window using **`$1`** syntax (or `$2`, `$3`, etc.). Pinned objects are also marked in quick watches, even within arrays and inside other objects.

## Editor

IntelliSense tool-tips and error tool-tips are now shown even during debugging. Previously, tool-tips were only displayed when Visual Studio was in design mode (not debug mode).

## Fixes

- Rename refactoring correctly replaces class names within `extends` and `implements`.

- Fixes some errors locations, e.g. the warning about overflowing an integer number into floating-point number.
