### Improved Code Navigation

- Go To: (<kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + T</kbd>) lets you quickly find and go to files, types, methods, and other elements in your code. It gives you a one-stop way to go to any kind of item you need, even in large code bases. What's more, if you know what kind of item you're after you can filter down easily.

- Go To Line (<kbd>Ctrl+G</kbd>) is modernized as well.

### Open Folder

Open Folder is a convenient way for you to work with code bases without projects and solutions. Navigate to a folder by opening the File Menu, clicking Open, and then clicking Folder. Before the release we're also going to support Advanced Intellisense and debugging capabilities which you are used to from PHP Projects.

### EditorConfig Support

Visual Studio editor now supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/), which allows developers to define and maintain consistent coding style conventions between different editors and IDEs. PHP Tools for Visual Studio is going to support this feature. However it's not supported at this moment.
