Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) are integral part of most PHP applications. Therefore it's important to make developing with them easy and transparent.  PHP Tools for Visual Studio 2019 introduces several neat features making the editing and testing such expressions a fluent experience. The features are the following:

- colorization of the expression
- highlighting of matching parentheses
- validation and error reporting
- separate *Regex Tool Window* which highlights expression, updates the regex expression in corresponding PHP code, shows regex groups, allows to test the regex with a test subject and see all the matches, matched groups, and matched captures.
