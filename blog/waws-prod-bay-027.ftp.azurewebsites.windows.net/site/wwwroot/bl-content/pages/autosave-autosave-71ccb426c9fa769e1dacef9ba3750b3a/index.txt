XAMPP is a cross-platform Apache HTTP server distribution containing MariaDB (fork of MySQL) database, PHP, and Perl. The word "XAMPP" is an acronym. There is no official explaning of if, but we can safely assume that "X" stands for "cross", meaning "cross-platform", A would be Apache, M is MariaDB. While first P would be short for PHP and second P for Pearl or reversed?

## Getting the XAMPP installer

From the Apache friends website, download the package that matches your platform. For this tutorial we are going to use Windows and PHP 8.0. https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

## Installing the XAMPP

Once we've download it the installar we can run it. If you have UAC enabled enabled XAMPP installer will recommend you not to install it into the Program Files folder.

![UAC warning](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/uac.png)

Select the components in which you are insterested in. Usually it's sufficient to install only Apache, MySQL and PHP. But feel free to install whatever you are planning to use.

![XAMPP Installation Wizard](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/wizard.png)

Choose the directory where the XAMPP will install. For the rest of the tutorial I'm going to assume you've chosen the default `c:\xampp`

![Installation Directory](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/xampp-installation-dir.png)

![XAMPP Installation](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/xamppinstallation.png)

And we're done! After the installation we can click **Finish** to launch XAMPP control panel.

## Running the servers

Once you are in XAMPP control panel, you can perform several tasks such as running or stopping the services as Apache, MySQL, etc. By default Apache should start immediately, but in my case it didn't, because my port 80 was blocked. 

![Apache didn't start - port 80 was occpued](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/occupiedport.png)

I knew I had IIS running, so I just stopped it. Returned to XAMPP Control panel and clicked Start. This time I was prompted by firewall to allow Apache. Click **Allow access**

![Firewall prompt](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/firewall.png)

The apache is now running.

![Apache is running](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/xampprunning.png)

## Running the servers as Windows Service

By default non of these server are running as Windows Service. If you'd wish them to run as service (e.g. because you want them to start immeditely when Windows will start). Open XAMPP Control panel as administrator, click on **Stop** to stop the service and click on **X** next to the service.

![XAMPP running under admin](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/xampp-as-admin.png)

Are you sure? Click **Yes**

![Are you sure](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/xampp-apache-as-service.png)

Now, the server is installed as Windows Service. But you can always start/stop it from this Control Panel, or uninstall it as Windows Service by clicking on green check box next to the server.

## Install Xdebug

Now when you XAMPP you are almost ready, but to be able to properly develop you will need [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/). By default XAMPP doesn't provide PHP with Xdebug extension, so we will need to get if ourselves. To find out which version to download, go to the XAMPP Control Panel and click on **Shell** button.

![Shell button](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/shell-button.png)

Type `php --version`:

![Image description](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/php-version.png)

I highlighted PHP version, Architecture(32 bit or 64 bit) and Thread safety (TS). You will use these three variables to get the correct version of Xdebug. Now got to [https://xdebug.org/download](https://xdebug.org/download) and get the correct version. In this case it will be `PHP 8.0 VS16 TS (64 bit)`

![Xdebug 8.0 64bit TS](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/xdebug-version.png)

Download the library and copy it to `c:\xampp\php\ext\` and rename it to `php_xdebug.dll`. Then open `c:\xampp\php\php.ini`, scroll all the way down and copy the following snippet and save the file.

```ini
[XDebug]
zend_extension = "c:\xampp\php\ext\php_xdebug.dll"
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host = 127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port = 9003
xdebug.start_with_request=trigger
```

> **Note** This snippet is for Xdebug 3.0 and higher; If you need Xdebug 2.0 it would be different.

In the XAMPP Control Panel, restart the Apache by clicking **Stop** and **Start**.

You can verify the Xdebug is properly installed by running `php --version` again.

## Integrating XAMPP with IDE

We're almost all set to start developing PHP projects on XAMPP, but to be able to do it efficiently we will need some sort of IDE. In the following paragraphs I will present how to start using XAMPP with both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. So please feel free to skip directly to the IDE you are intestered in.

### Visual Studio

I'm going to assume you have Visual Studio and PHP Tools for Visual Studio both installed. In this tutorial I'm showing screenshots from Visual Studio 2019, but it shouldn't matter. You can start the instance of VS and select **Create a new project**.

![Visual Studio 2019 Initial Dialog](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/vs2019-initial-dialog.png)

Select PHP in the language filter and click on PHP Web Project, hit **Next**:

![Visual Studio 2019 Create New Project](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/vs2019-new-project.png)

Name the project, as a location fill `c:\xampp\htdocs` and hit **Create**

![Visual Studio 2019 Configure New Project](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/vs-configure-new-project.png)

Select the template, e.g. Empty Web Site and enable Common Project System. It's a new type of project system PHP Tools provide since Visual Studio 2019, lacking few features, but still it's much better than the old one. Hit **OK**.

![Visual Studio 2019 New PHP Web Project](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/vs-new-php-web-project.png)

Once your new PHP project is created, go to the project properties. Right click on project node in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Project Properties** (or select the project node in the **Solution Explorer** and press <kbd>Shift+F4</kbd>). In the **Project Properties** tab, choose **Server** tab.

Change the Server to **Custom** and fill in server URL. In our case it's going to be http://localhost/XampTestProject . Xdebug port should be 9003 which is the default since Xdebug 3. Close the **Project Properties** tab and save the project.

![Project Properties Server tab](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/autosave-71ccb426c9fa769e1dacef9ba3750b3a/vs-project-custom.png)

Now back in the project, press <kbd>F10</kbd> the debug session should start and break on the first statement of the script.

Congrats you are all setup to develop using XAMPP with Visual Studio.
