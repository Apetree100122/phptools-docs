Today, I'm excited to announce that we are making PHP Tools for Visual Studio available at Microsoft DreamSpark catalog.

We've partnered with Microsoft DreamSpark program so students can get [PHP Tools for Visual Studio for free](https://www.dreamspark.com/Product/Product.aspx?productid=106).

Together with [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.dreamspark.com/Product/Product.aspx?productid=106) students get a powerful PHP development environment at no cost!
