Very often a PHP project consists of several separately hosted applications, such as a public website and some API. In case developer wants to run and debug his set of applications locally, there is a very useful feature in VS Code called **compound launch**.

## the problem

For the purposes of this tutorial, we have two PHP applications. One is an imaginary frontend, in a subfolder **"./public"**. The second one is a backend API in a subfolder **"./api"**. Frontend needs API, and the developer needs to debug both of them at the same time.

Usually there has to be a web server configured to serve both of the applications. Note, that in order to debug both applications at the same time, it would be necessary to setup DbgpProxy or to setup Xdebug outcoming port differently for both of the applications. Then the IDE needs to be configured in the same way to properly attach to the running server.

But what if we'd like to not configure the web server and take advantage of the IDE and PHP's built-in web server (also called development server)? All the necessary configuration would be within the VS Code workspace, and developer would start and stop the project from within his development environment.

## launch.json

VS Code is well equipped for launching two or more launch configurations at once. But does it work with PHP and it's debugging extension?

First, let's open `.vscode/launch.json` special file, that tells VS Code what's supposed to be started upon running the project (`F5`).

- define launch 1;
- define launch 2

- define compound launch
- specify whether to stop everything when we click stop

## port configuration

- mind the port - do not set it, or set two different ports
- will be maintained by phptools
